class DataDesignerFactory:
    """Factory class for creating DataDesigner instances.

    Each class method on this object provides a different way to instantiate
    a DataDesigner object, depending on your use case and desired workflow.

    Allowed session keyword arguments:
        api_key (str): Your Gretel API key. If set to "prompt" and no API key
            is found on the system, you will be prompted for the key.
        endpoint (str): Specifies the Gretel API endpoint. This must be a fully
            qualified URL. The default is "https://api.gretel.cloud".
        default_runner (str): Specifies the runner mode. Must be one of "cloud",
            "local", "manual", or "hybrid". The default is "cloud".
        artifact_endpoint (str): Specifies the endpoint for project and model
            artifacts. Defaults to "cloud" for running in Gretel Cloud. If
            working in hybrid mode, set to the URL of your artifact storage bucket.
        cache (str): Valid options are "yes" or "no". If set to "no", the session
            configuration will not be written to disk. If set to "yes", the
            session configuration will be written to disk only if one doesn't
            already exist. The default is "no".
        validate (bool): If `True`, will validate the login credentials at
            instantiation. The default is `False`.
        clear (bool): If `True`, existing Gretel credentials will be removed.
            The default is `False.`
