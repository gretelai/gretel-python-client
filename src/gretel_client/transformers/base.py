"""
This module contains the base ``Transformer`` class that can be used
create an actual transformer instance. It essentially is used as a factory
that takes a specific config object as the only argument at construction time.

NOTE:
    The primary interface in this module is the ``Transformer`` class which
    acts as a factory. While you may init any ``Transformer`` directly and interact
    with it, generally the individual objects are inserted into a ``RecordTransformerPipeline``
    which is the primary / preferred interface.
